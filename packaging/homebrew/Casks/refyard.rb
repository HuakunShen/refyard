# The Homebrew cask for the Refyard desktop app.
#
# This file lives in the Refyard repository as the source of truth; each release, the
# version and the two sha256 values are filled from the real release artifacts and the
# result is pushed to `HuakunShen/homebrew-tap` as `Casks/refyard.rb` (the push is the
# owner's action — this repository never pushes).
#
# After a release exists, fill the sha256 values with:
#   shasum -a 256 <(curl -sL <dmg url>)   # or: brew fetch --cask after tapping
# then verify locally with:
#   brew audit --cask refyard
#   brew install --cask HuakunShen/tap/refyard
